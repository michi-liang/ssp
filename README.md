odfinal.py contains code for orbital determination. Code takes in three observation data points, and returns velocity vector and using Method of Gauss.
  The final function is used to output user friendly data in the format of Position Vector, Velocity Vector, Range, Orbital Components, and Mean Anomaly.
  The finalmonte function outputs data used in montecarlo.py
montecarlo.py was the function used for generating Monte Carlo Data. 
  Code contains constants used in the determination of 2253 Espinette. 
  Outputs graph.
